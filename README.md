# Disease_Prediction_System

This project focuses on developing a disease prediction system using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to predict the likelihood of two critical diseases - breast cancer and heart disease - based on relevant features. The missing values in the dataset are imputed with the mean and KNN values of the corresponding columns and three different ML algorithms are used to check for the accuracy of the disease prediction.
